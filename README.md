- `osascript -e 'id of app "####"'` - Find #### id to change the defaults
- `defaults domains` - See all domains
- `defaults import {domain} {plist}` -  Import a plist
- `defaults export {domain} {pathToPlist}` -  Export a plist
- `plutil -convert xml1 {pathOfPlistToConvert}` - Convert a binary plist to xml, easier to edit.

## TODO
